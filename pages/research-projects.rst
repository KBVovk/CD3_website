`HSC`_
-------

Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) is a prime focus camera at the 8.2m Subaru Telescope. Anyone who is working at an institute in Japan has the right of full data access (access to the proprietary data/data products). To join the HSC collaboration, please visit the page "information for new members" in the `HSC wiki`_.

Please carefully read through the `"collaboration policy"`_. Main communication channels are the wikipage and mailing lists (you can find which mailing list is available in the wikipage), and slack for the HSC Weak Lensing WG. If you agree with the policy, you are now a member of HSC (please join)!

The following are key papers of the HSC-SSP survey (SSP=Subaru Strategic Program).

`PFS`_
-------

Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) is a massively-multiplexed fiber-fed optical and near-infrared 3-arm spectrograph (N_fiber=2400, 380<lambda<1260nm, 1.3 degree diameter FoV) at the Subaru Telescope. We envision we will start our survey from around 2024. 

Anyone who is working at an institute in Japan has the right of full data access for PFS. If you want to join the PFS collaboration, please make registration via `here`_, in the `PFS website`_. 

Main communication channels are the `wikipage`_ and mailing lists.

`LSST`_
-------
For the first ten years of operation, Vera C. Rubin Observatory will perform the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) , using the 3.2 Gigapixel Rubin Observatory LSST Camera and the 8.4-m Simonyi Survey Telescope. Work toward meeting the LSST science goals is being carried out by the Rubin Observatory LSST `Dark Energy Science Collaboration`_ (DESC). Key working groups are Weak gravitational lensing, Large-scale structure, Type Ia Supernovae, Galaxy clusters, and Strong gravitational lensing.

If you are interested in working on LSST, please contact: Jia Liu, Masahiro Takada, Naoki Yasuda

`Euclid`_
---------

Euclid is a visible to near-infrared space telescope currently under development by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Euclid Consortium. The objective of the Euclid mission is to better understand dark energy and dark matter by accurately measuring the acceleration of the universe. Euclid is a medium-class ("M-class") mission and is part of the Cosmic Vision campaign of ESA's Science Programme. This class of missions have an ESA budget cap at around €500 million. Prior to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the launch was scheduled on a Soyuz ST 2-1b in 2023, but Euclid will instead be launched on an Ariane 62.

If you are interested in working on Euclid, please contact: John Silverman, Masahiro Takada, Naoki Yasuda

Roman
The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope is a NASA observatory designed to settle essential questions in the areas of dark energy, exoplanets, and infrared astrophysics. The telescope has a primary mirror that is 2.4 meters in diameter (7.9 feet), and is the same size as the Hubble Space Telescope's primary mirror. The Roman Space Telescope will have two instruments, the Wide Field Instrument, and the Coronagraph Instrument.

The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope is designed to be capable of a set of notional observing programs that form Roman’s design reference mission, and whose execution would fulfill the mission’s top level science objectives. These include three Core Community Surveys and a significant program of General Astrophysics Surveys, undertaken with the Wide Field Instrument (WFI); and a set of technology demonstration observations undertaken with the Coronagraph Instrument. The Core Community Surveys are the High Latitude Wide Area Survey; the High Latitude Time Domain Survey; and the Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey. All Roman observations will be publicly available with no period of limited access.

LiteBIRD
LiteBIRD is a satellite that will search for primordial gravitational waves emitted during the cosmic inflation era (around 10–38 sec after the beginning of the Universe). It aims to test representative inflationary models (single-ﬁeld slow-role models with large ﬁeld variation) by performing an all-sky CMB polarization survey. In addition to inflation science, LiteBIRD can deliver comprehensive science outputs: reionization history and neutrino mass, cosmic birefringence, Galactic sciences, and more.

You can find more information about LiteBIRD and CMB gangs at IPMU:

Simons Observatory
The Simons Observatory (SO) is a ground-based cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiment situated on Cerrro Toco, 5300 m (17,000 feet) above the Atacama Desert in Chile. SO key targets are: the physics of primordial perturbations, identifying the correct model of an early inflationary epoch of the Universe; effective number of relativistic species; the sum of neutrino masses; observable deviations from the cosmological constant paradigm; galaxy evolution; redshift and duration of the reionization epoch.

If you are interested in working on SO, please reach out to SO senior members at IPMU:
Nobu Katayama (SAT instrumentation), Jia Liu (extragalactic foreground simulations), Tomotake Matsumura (SAT instrumentation), Toshiya Namikawa (CMB lensing and data analysis).

CMB-S4
CMB-S4 is the next-generation ground-based cosmic microwave background experiment, expected to start operation in early 2030s. With 21 telescopes at the South Pole and in the Chilean Atacama desert surveying the sky with over 500,000 cryogenically-cooled superconducting detectors for 7 years, CMB-S4 will deliver transformative discoveries in fundamental physics, cosmology, astrophysics, and astronomy.

https://cmb-s4.org/
Japan is currently under negotiation to join CMB-S4. Please reach out to the CMB group if you are interested.
